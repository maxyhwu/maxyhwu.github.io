In my leisure time, I enjoy watching baseball and listening to classical music. I am a loyal fan of both the Uni-Lions and the Dodgers, with Clayton Kershaw as my favorite player. I have also played the piano and flute since a young age, and my passion for classical music continues to this day. I especially love Rachmaninoff\'s piano concertos, which are true masterpieces. I also have a deep appreciation for Dvořák\'s symphonies, which are among my favorites. *If you have not heard their works yet, I highly recommend giving them a listen!*
