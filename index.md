#### Diversity Statement
Born and raised in **Taiwan**, a beautiful and diverse island in East Asia, I am proud of my roots and the values of inclusion and equality that Taiwan embraces. As a frequent host of Pride Parades, Taiwan champions diversity, and it inspires me to promote acceptance and mutual respect in all areas of life. **With a firm belief that everyone deserves to be seen and heard, I deeply respect and support all individuals and communities.** I also value the opportunity to build new connections, so feel free to [reach me out](#contact) if you are visiting Taiwan!

#### Life
Currently, I live with my family, and we have three super adorable kittens: 荳荳 (Tou-Tou), 小小 (Hsiao-Hsiao), and 刷刷 (Shua-Shua).

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching baseball and listening to classical music. I am a loyal fan of both the Uni-Lions and the Dodgers, with Clayton Kershaw as my favorite player. He inspired my childhood decision to play baseball and dream of becoming an ace pitcher like him. Although I did not ultimately pursue baseball as a career, that ambition has driven me to persevere through challenges, pushing me to keep moving forward no matter the obstacles.

I have also played the piano and flute since a young age, and my passion for classical music continues to this day. I especially love Rachmaninoff\'s piano concertos, which are true masterpieces. I also have a deep appreciation for Dvořák\'s symphonies, which are among my favorites. *If you have not heard their works yet, I highly recommend giving them a listen!*
