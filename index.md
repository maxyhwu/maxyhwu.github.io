<!--### About Me-->

#### Current Position
I am a research assistant at [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about/about.html) and [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en/Tab/4), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Yih-Kuen Tsay](http://im.ntu.edu.tw/~tsay/) and [Dr. Yu-Fang Chen](https://bull.iis.sinica.edu.tw/yfc/doku.php). I obtained my bachelor\'s degree from NTU earlier this year. I will be serving in the military starting in December 2024 and expect to fulfill the obligation by May 2025.

#### Research Interests
My research interests are **formal verification**, **program derivation**, **functional programming**, and **automata theory**. Recently I am also working on **quantum program verification**.

#### Life
Currently, I live with my family, and we have three super adorable kittens: [Dou Dou (荳荳), Hsiao Hsiao (小小), and Sha Sha (刷刷)](#kitten).

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching baseball and listening to classical music. I am a loyal fan of both the Uni-Lions and the Dodgers, with Clayton Kershaw as my favorite player. He inspired my childhood decision to play baseball and dream of becoming an ace pitcher like him. Although I did not ultimately pursue baseball as a career, that ambition has driven me to persevere through challenges, pushing me to keep moving forward no matter the obstacles.

I have also played the piano and flute since a young age, and my passion for classical music continues to this day. I especially love Rachmaninoff\'s piano concertos, which are true masterpieces. I also have a deep appreciation for Dvořák\'s symphonies, which are among my favorites. *If you have not heard their works yet, I highly recommend giving them a listen!*
